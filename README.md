# Stream Widget for Spotify
A good looking Spotify overlay for streaming

## What did I change?
I made the colour themes and light/dark mode sync with the settings window so its not just the viewer!<br/>
Another thing I added is a nice spash screen before launching the software<br/>
I also updated some packages but SpotifyAPI-NET is still running on 5.1.1

## To Dos:
Make text look nicer on white background<br/>
Add option for custom colour<br/>

## [Download](https://github.com/Dankyss/Spotify-Stream-Widget/releases)

## How to use it?
1. Download from the releases tab<br/>
2. Start `Stream Widget for Spotify.exe`<br/>
3. Customize the way you want and authenticate with Spotify<br/>
4. For OBS, add a window capture and capture `Spotify Viewer`<br/>
